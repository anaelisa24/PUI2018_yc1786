-The NULL hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis are presented and formulated correctly both verbally and numerically.

-The data required to answer the question is accessable and available. All the unrequired data has been dropped to avoid confussion and provide clarity. 

-A further improvement would be to separate the data into two dataframes, one for men and one for women, to ease the data manipulation process instead of accessing the main dataframe through specific the gender type.


Suggestions:

-The question we are asking in this test is "Is there an association between the gender of the rider and the duration of the trip?". 

-We are dealing with numerical data but we are not sure about the distribution of the data and whether it follows a normal distribution or not.

-Moreover, the data is divided into two groups, men and women.

-Therefore,  it would be best to use the "Mann-Whitney U test"to answer the question.
